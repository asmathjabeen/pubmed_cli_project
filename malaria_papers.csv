Killing of Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes by selective triketone 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase inhibitors depends on a high protein meal.,"The malaria vector Anopheles stephensi has expanded from Asia into Eastern Africa, posing a growing global health threat due to its adaptive biology and increasing resistance to conventional control methods. Here, we characterise 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD), a crucial enzyme in the tyrosine degradation pathway, and demonstrate its potential as a novel drug target in Anopheles stephensi. Homology modelling combined with molecular dynamics simulations confirmed that key inhibitor-binding residues are highly conserved across mosquito HPPDs and predicted potent inhibition by triketone-based compounds. Using cell-based assay with codon-optimised recombinant expression in Escherichia coli, we screened several triketone and diketonitrile HPPD inhibitors and identified nitisinone as the most potent inhibitor, displaying nanomolar-range IC","Matěj Kučera, David Hartmann, James J Valdés, Adéla Palusová, Avinash Sheshachalam, Marnix Vlot, Martijn W Vos, Koen J Dechering, Jan Perner"
DDT: last mile in the global phase-out of its use for disease vector control?,"Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), one of the persistent organic pollutants to be phased out globally under the Stockholm Convention, still continues to be used in some countries as an insecticide for malaria vector control. The global production and use of DDT has reduced substantially over the last 8 years, and the number of alternative insecticides for vector control has increased steadily, suggesting that a global phase-out of DDT is within reach. Only three countries, India, South Africa, and Zimbabwe, were still using DDT in 2023, and a few other countries are keeping the option open of using DDT for emergency response. The main challenges in the global elimination of DDT are that most of the alternative insecticides are less affordable compared with DDT and that the global progress in malaria control and elimination has stagnated. Consultation meetings with countries that intend to use DDT have enabled a sharing of experiences and challenges in phasing out DDT. This Personal View provides recommendations to attain a global phase-out of DDT and to address the problem of disposal of obsolete stocks.","Henk van den Berg, Hilma R Amwele, Basil D Brooke, Lina E Fortelius, Tanu Jain, S H P Parakrama Karunaratne, Nosiku S Munyinda, Yasmin Rubio-Palis, Rajpal S Yadav, Immo Kleinschmidt"
Non-typhoidal Salmonella combination vaccines: clinical development plan and regulatory considerations.,"Invasive non-typhoidal serovars of Salmonella enterica,S. Typhimurium and S. Enteritidis, (iNTS) are estimated to cause over 500,000 cases of disease leading to more than 79,000 deaths with a high case fatality ratio of 14.5 %. Most infections occur in infants and young children in LMICs in sub-Saharan Africa where host risk factors for iNTS disease such as malaria, malnutrition, HIV infection, and anemia are common. iNTS disease is observed from birth, with a peak incidence early in the second year of life, declining before the age of 3 years. The prevalence of multiple drug resistance of iNTS has increased markedly by decade, emphasizing the need for effective vaccines. A clinical development plan and regulatory pathway for licensure of iNTS vaccines has been shaped following the development of Preferred Product Characteristics and R&D Roadmap through a series of expert consultations. Several iNTS alone or combined with Typhoid Conjugate Vaccine platforms are in early clinical development. Encouraging safety and immunogenicity data have prompted developers and manufacturers to plan efficacy trials, aligned with regulatory expectations. It is critical to clearly communicate iNTS disease burden in endemic countries and to discuss complexities related to iNTS single component or combination vaccine clinical development with regulators. An essential component is the disease burden in infants less than 6 months of age, which will inform the optimal age of first vaccination (less than or from 6 months), compatibility across national expanded programme on immunization schedules, and whether a booster dose would be needed. Early regulatory guidance is essential to make informed regulatory decisions and to guide the clinical development plan and licensure pathway. Continued communication with public health stakeholders and end-user representatives will effectively contribute to better awareness and education about iNTS disease and protection afforded by vaccination.","Jean-Louis Excler, Tarun Saluja, Annelies Wilder-Smith, Robert W Kaminski, Calman A MacLennan, Marco Cavaleri, Jerome H Kim"
Bridging urban-rural disparities in malaria care during pregnancy in Senegal: evidence from household and health facility surveys.,"Despite the World Health Organization's recommendations, the uptake of Intermittent Preventive Treatment in pregnancy with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (IPTp-SP) in Senegal remains suboptimal, with disparities observed between urban and rural areas. More remains to be known about how malaria service readiness would affect the utilization of IPTp-SP.","Yongsheng Jiang, Di Liang, Jinkou Zhao, Shailendra Prasad, Medoune Ndiop, Serigne Amdy Thiam, Ibrahima Diallo, Doudou Sene, Rose Mpembeni, Jiayan Huang"
COVID-19 infection and its association with severe malaria & dengue: an epidemiological study from Southern India.,"Post-Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19) sequelae involve complex biological processes that can alter the progression and clinical outcome of other infectious diseases. However, there is no documented information on the influence of COVID-19 on the development of severe malaria and dengue. Hence, this study was conducted to determine the association between malaria & dengue and previous COVID-19 infection among the adult population of Mangalore Taluk and to describe the socio-demographic and clinical correlates of malaria & dengue.","Sara J Ommen, Prasanna Mithra, Rekha T, Nithin Kumar, Ramesh Holla, Naveen Kulal, Mithun Rao, Bhaskaran Unnikrishnan"
